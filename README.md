This project contains an integration between the SQLAlchemy ORM and Flask-Venom. 

The goal is to develop both Venom and Venom-Entities until Venom-Entities reaches feature parity with Flask-Potion. 


Key missing magic elements:

- ~~Resolve generics (e.g. generic TypeVar of ModelService) to be able to offer reusable methods.~~
- ~~Autogenerate messages for ListEntityRequest etc. Will require a decorator to do this.~~
- ToOne/ToMany fields with an EntityID message type that enforces the correct type
- ~~Autogenerate messages for normal RPC methods~~

  - Also need CLI reflection to export Python stubs as services with autogenerated messages cannot be shared otherwise
- ~~Reflection and OpenAPI/Swagger schema service~~
